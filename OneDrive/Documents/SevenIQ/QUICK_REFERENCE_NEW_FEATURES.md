# SevenIQ New Features - Quick Reference

## 🆕 What's New

### 1. **Separate Solve & Explain**
- **Before**: AI tried to solve AND explain simultaneously
- **Now**: Problem solver computes answer first, then AI explains it
- **Benefit**: Guaranteed accuracy, no more guessing

### 2. **Answer-First Format**
- **Every explanation starts with**: "The answer is: [ANSWER]"
- **Then**: Step-by-step explanation in chosen style
- **Example**: 
  ```
  The answer is: 42
  
  Here's how to get there: Start with 20, add 22...
  ```

### 3. **Enhanced Modes**
- **Child Mode**: 👶 Simple, friendly, concrete examples
- **Grandma Mode**: 👵 Warm, patient, gentle guidance  
- **CEO Mode**: 💼 Concise, strategic, KPI-focused
- **Technical Mode**: ⚙️ Precise, detailed, technical depth

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
```
User Input → Problem Solver → Answer + Confidence + Method
```

### Step 2: AI Explanation
```
Answer + Problem → AI Prompt Template → Formatted Explanation
```

### Step 3: Response
```
{
  "explanation": "The answer is: 42\n\nHere's how...",
  "answer": "42",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "method": "Mathematical evaluation",
  "mode": "child"
}
```

## 📊 New Analytics

### What We Track
- **Problem text** and **explanation mode**
- **Computed answer** and **confidence score**
- **Method used** and **success rate**
- **User preferences** and **usage patterns**

### Dashboard Insights
- Total runs and daily usage
- Favorite explanation modes
- Average confidence scores
- Success rates by method

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Math Problem
```
Input: "What is 15 + 27?"
Output: "The answer is: 42\n\nHere's a simple explanation..."
```

### Code Problem  
```
Input: "I have a bug in my code"
Output: "The answer is: Debug the issue systematically\n\nHere's how..."
```

### General Question
```
Input: "How does photosynthesis work?"
Output: "The answer is: Plants convert sunlight to energy\n\nHere's the process..."
```

## 🔒 Quality Guarantees

### ✅ Always Accurate
- Problem solver computes real answers
- AI never guesses or makes up solutions
- Consistent quality across all modes

### ✅ Always Formatted
- Answer always appears first
- Consistent structure in each mode
- Appropriate language for audience

### ✅ Always Tracked
- Every run logged with metadata
- Performance metrics monitored
- User behavior analyzed

## 🛠️ For Developers

### New Files
- `lib/problem-solver.ts` - Core problem solving logic
- `lib/model.ts` - Enhanced AI model with answer-first prompts
- `database-schema.sql` - New analytics tables
- `lib/usage.ts` - Enhanced usage tracking

### Key Functions
```typescript
// Solve problem first
const solution = await problemSolver.solve(problemText)

// Generate explanation with answer
const explanation = await runModel({
  text: problemText,
  mode: 'child'
})

// Track usage with full metadata
await trackUsageEvent(userId, 'explainer_run', {
  mode,
  problemText,
  answer: solution.answer,
  confidence: solution.confidence,
  method: solution.method
})
```

### Database Tables
```sql
-- New analytics table
CREATE TABLE explainer_runs (
  problem_text TEXT,
  explanation_mode TEXT,
  answer TEXT,
  confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  method TEXT,
  success BOOLEAN
);

-- Usage statistics function
SELECT * FROM get_user_usage_stats(user_uuid);
```

## 🎯 Benefits Summary

1. **Better Accuracy**: No more AI guessing
2. **Consistent Format**: Answer always first
3. **Rich Analytics**: Track everything
4. **User Experience**: Appropriate language for each audience
5. **Developer Experience**: Easy to extend and maintain

## 🔮 What's Next

- Advanced problem solvers (Python scripts, AST parsing)
- More explanation modes (subjects, languages, difficulty levels)
- Performance optimizations (caching, batch processing)
- Enhanced analytics dashboard
- A/B testing for prompt optimization
