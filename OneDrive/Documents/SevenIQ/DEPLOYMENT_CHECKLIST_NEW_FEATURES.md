# SevenIQ New Features - Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Implementation
- [x] Problem solver service implemented
- [x] Enhanced model with answer-first prompts
- [x] Updated API route with new fields
- [x] Enhanced usage tracking
- [x] Database schema updated
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Fallback mechanisms in place

### ✅ Database Setup
- [ ] Run updated `database-schema.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify `explainer_runs` table created
- [ ] Test `get_user_usage_stats` function
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are active
- [ ] Test user permissions

### ✅ Environment Variables
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set
- [ ] `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` configured (if using payments)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` set correctly

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Database Migration**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will create the new table and function
\i database-schema.sql
```

### 2. **Code Deployment**
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel/your platform
vercel --prod
```

### 3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Test problem solver with math problems
- [ ] Verify answer-first formatting in all modes
- [ ] Check usage tracking is working
- [ ] Monitor error logs for issues
- [ ] Test with different user types

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Problem solver correctly identifies problem types
- [ ] Math problems return accurate answers
- [ ] Mode prompts generate correct format
- [ ] API route handles all scenarios
- [ ] Usage tracking captures all data

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end explanation flow works
- [ ] Database operations succeed
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully
- [ ] Fallback responses are appropriate

### User Experience Tests
- [ ] Answers always appear first
- [ ] Explanations match selected mode
- [ ] Response times are acceptable
- [ ] Error messages are helpful

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Response Times**: Should be under 5 seconds
- **Success Rates**: Should be above 95%
- **Error Rates**: Should be below 5%
- **Usage Patterns**: Track mode preferences
- **Confidence Scores**: Monitor solution quality

### Alerts to Configure
- [ ] High error rates (>10%)
- [ ] Slow response times (>10 seconds)
- [ ] OpenAI API failures
- [ ] Database connection issues
- [ ] High memory usage

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- [ ] User data properly anonymized in analytics
- [ ] RLS policies prevent data leakage
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input sanitization working

### API Security
- [ ] Authentication required for usage tracking
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Input validation blocks malicious requests
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] Consider caching common problem solutions
- [ ] Implement response caching for repeated questions
- [ ] Cache user preferences and settings

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Partition large tables by date if needed
- [ ] Monitor query performance

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate**: Disable new features via feature flags
2. **Short-term**: Revert to previous model implementation
3. **Long-term**: Fix issues and redeploy

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# Or redeploy previous version
git checkout previous-commit
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

## 📋 Post-Deployment Tasks

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
- [ ] Gather user feedback on new format
- [ ] Check analytics data quality
- [ ] Optimize based on usage patterns

### Week 2
- [ ] Review confidence score distributions
- [ ] Analyze mode preference trends
- [ ] Identify any edge cases or issues
- [ ] Plan next iteration improvements

### Month 1
- [ ] Full performance review
- [ ] User satisfaction survey
- [ ] Analytics dashboard review
- [ ] Roadmap planning for next features

## 🎯 Success Criteria
